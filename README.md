### Technologies

We've use sass implemented via the official method [link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc).

**note** - Due to the simplicity of the app we will not use `css-modules`, but its ideally good to do so to prevent style bleeding.
